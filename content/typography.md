title: Typography and Rhythm

Typography isn't just about fonts. It's the voice of the text, its character, tone, and even emotion. For Oro, we've chosen **Inter**.

## ✨ Why Inter?

![[Pasted image 20250717230449.png]]

**Inter** is a modern, clean, and versatile sans-serif that's perfect for digital products. It was created by designer Rasmus Andersson specifically for screens and interfaces, ensuring maximum clarity and reading comfort.

But here's what's interesting — Inter is largely inspired by and closely related to **San Francisco**, the typeface developed by Apple for their products.

## 📖 The Connection Between Inter and San Francisco

**San Francisco** was created by Apple to replace the legendary Helvetica Neue. Apple designed it specifically to be perfectly legible on small screens like iPhone and Apple Watch.

Inter inherited many of these approaches and principles. Both typefaces share:

- High readability and clarity of letterforms;

- Friendliness and humanity without unnecessary decoration;

- Technological precision and clarity in every character.


By using Inter, we convey the same spirit of technological humanism that Apple is known for — where technology becomes a natural, seamless part of our lives.

## 🍎 Inspired by Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs, Apple's founder, always saw fonts as more than just letters on a screen. In his famous Stanford speech, he recalled a calligraphy course he stumbled upon almost by accident in college. That experience became pivotal in understanding how crucial typography is to product perception and brand communication.

When Jobs designed the first Mac, he devoted enormous attention to fonts — it was thanks to him that the Mac became the first personal computer with beautiful and functional typography. He believed that good design is respect for the user, an expression of care and even love for people.

The typeface we've chosen is a tribute to this approach. Through Inter, Oro strives to be not only readable and clear, but also caring, respectful, and aesthetically pleasing.

title: Building Oro Interfaces
---
Oro's interfaces are more than just technology. They're how people perceive us, how they experience our product. It's important to us that we create interfaces that speak a human language, work naturally, and look beautiful.

Our choice is **Vue.js** and its ecosystem **Nuxt**.

## ✨ Why Vue.js?

Vue.js is a story about people and inspiration. It wasn't created by massive corporations like React (Facebook) or Angular (Google). It was developed by a living community united by a shared idea — to make development simpler, more accessible, and more human.

That's why Vue resonates so deeply with our spirit:

- It's easy to learn,

- Understandable and transparent,

- Created and maintained by people, for people.


When we choose Vue, we choose the philosophy of an open, vibrant, and friendly community.

## 🚀 Nuxt — A Platform That Brings Together the Best

Nuxt is built on top of Vue and is growing rapidly. Its strength lies in thoughtful infrastructure that ensures harmony and consistency:

- **Flexibility and modularity.**
    Each module integrates seamlessly, allowing Oro to adapt quickly to new challenges.

- **Developer experience (DX).**
    Nuxt was created by people who understand how important it is for developers to work comfortably and efficiently. Everything is built with respect for the person behind the screen.

- **An ecosystem that creates cohesion.**
    In Nuxt, everything works together smoothly. We use ready-made components that help us stay unified and recognizable.

## 🌱 Respect for Others' Work

We understand and value the contributions of the community and the creators behind the technologies we use. That's why:

- We use third-party tools carefully and respectfully, honoring licenses and copyrights.

- We openly acknowledge the solutions we use, thank their creators, and support their development.


For us, this isn't just about following the law — it's about showing respect for others' work.

## 🎯 Customization and Infrastructure Cohesion

Some Oro services use existing solutions built on other technologies. That's fine — what matters is the result and user convenience.

But our goal is to make transitions between services seamless. We carefully refine, configure, and adapt such solutions so that Oro's entire infrastructure feels cohesive, logical, and beautiful. Users shouldn't notice technical boundaries — they should simply receive a convenient and thoughtfully designed product.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Oro's interfaces are our philosophy expressed visually and functionally. We bet on simplicity, humanity, and respect. That's exactly why Vue and Nuxt are perfect for us — they were created by people inspired by the idea of making technology better and more accessible for everyone.

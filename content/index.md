Welcome to the Oro Brandbook.

It's a compass: to help you understand, preserve, and share the essence of what we're striving for.

## 💡 Remember

Every element, every piece of text, every decision should align with our shared vision, express care for the individual, and be genuine. **Preserving the trust we've earned, in word and deed — that's the fundamental principle of Oro.** When in doubt, choose the path with more meaning and kindness.

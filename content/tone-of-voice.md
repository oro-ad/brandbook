### 1. Respectful

We speak to people as equals, without condescension or arrogance.
**Example:**

> "We understand your time is valuable. Thank you for spending it with us."

Oro isn't a system — it's a community of real people. We speak naturally and warmly.
**Example:**

> "You're not alone — we'll figure this out together."

### 3. Calm and Confident

We avoid aggression and pressure. Our voice is a foundation, not a source of anxiety.

### 4. Thoughtful

Oro speaks only when there's something meaningful to say, with deep understanding of the topic. No filler words or empty slogans.
